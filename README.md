Oh no, I seem to have pushed a change to my codebase but accidentally reverted it. Could you help me recover it? Press the "commits" button (or the wheel button for mobile) and look through the commit history of the project. There should be a commit named "flag". My changes should be there!

Additionally, there seems to be a dispute among the maintainers of the codebase in the "Issues" section. Could you help me resolve it? The link to the next challenge should be there! However, the link seems to be a bit.ly link encrypted with a Caesar cipher that uses 7 shifts ('a' to 'h'). You might need to use an online Caesar cipher decryption tool.
